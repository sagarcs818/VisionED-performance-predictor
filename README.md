VisionED is an **AI-powered Student Performance Prediction System** that uses **Machine Learning (Random Forest Regressor)** integrated into a **Flask-based web application**.

The system predicts **End-Semester Marks and Attendance** based on students' academic performance indicators such as previous marks and attendance.

This project was developed as a **Minor Project** for
**New Government Polytechnic, Patna-13 (NGP)**.

VisionED provides a structured academic platform where students and administrators can manage **academic analytics, study materials, announcements, and academic queries**.

# 🤖 Machine Learning Approach

The system uses **Scikit-learn’s Random Forest Regressor** to model nonlinear relationships between academic indicators and final end-semester outcomes.

### 📥 Input Features

* Previous Semester Marks
* Previous Semester Attendance Percentage
* Internal Subject Marks (entered by students during prediction)

### 🎯 Target Variables

* Final End-Semester Marks
* Final End-Semester Attendance

The model is trained **separately for each Branch and Semester** using structured historical academic data from previous student batches.

Once trained, the system predicts **expected end-semester marks and attendance** based on student academic inputs.
